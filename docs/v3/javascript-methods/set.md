# Set 

## Set Property

Add a New Property.

The `.set('prop','value')` method allows you to assign a new value to an existing property of the object. If you want to update, replace, or assign new values to a property of the object, you can do so easily.

```javascript
// In this example, we will add the "count" property with a value of 10;
// Remember to replace PHP2JS with the Alias you have used.
PHP2JS.set("count", 10); 
```
