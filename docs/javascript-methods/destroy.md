# `.destroy()` 

## Destroy Object

The `.destroy()` method will empty the object passed from PHP to JavaScript. This will be useful when you want the values not to be accessible from different object references.

```javascript
// Destroy the Object (All object references will lose their values)
// Remember to replace PHP2JS with the Alias you have used.
PHP2JS.destroy();
```
