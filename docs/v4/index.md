## Introduction

While there are multiple frontend frameworks available today, we acknowledge that monoliths created with the Laravel Framework will continue to exist for a long time, and this is not necessarily a negative aspect. The most effective solution doesn't always lie in adopting the latest-generation framework. Sometimes, it is more efficient for a development team to leverage standard technologies and the knowledge they already possess.

By using technologies like jQuery, Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Laravel's Blade view engine, remarkable and highly functional results can be achieved. However, we felt something was missing: a simple, elegant, and efficient way to share data from the server to JavaScript on the frontend. We were uncomfortable inserting JavaScript snippets into our views; we always aimed to separate this logic into independent files.

It was then that server requests began to increase to retrieve variables that were already present in the view. After much contemplation on what would be the most effective solution, we decided to create this solution that standardizes and simplifies the process of sharing data from PHP to JavaScript.

You might be wondering how it's possible to achieve this, as there are different approaches in each programming language. Let us tell you that we faced that challenge too, but now we have overcome it.

Enjoy the ease of sharing data with JavaScript.
